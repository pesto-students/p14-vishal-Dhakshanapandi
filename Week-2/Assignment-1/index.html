      I'm Nobody! Who are you? <br /><br />
      Are You - Nobody - Too? <br />
      <br />
      Then there's a pair of us! <br />
      <br />Don't tell! They'd banish us - you know!
    </p>
    <p>
      How dreary - to be - Somebody!

      <br /><br />
      How public - like a Frog -

      <br />
      <br />
      To tell one's name - the livelong June - To an admiring Bog!
