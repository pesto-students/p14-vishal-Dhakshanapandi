         Yesterday, All those backups seemed a waste of pay. Now my database has gone away. Oh I believe in yesterday.

        Suddenly, There's not half the files there used to be, And there's a milestone  over me. The system crashed so suddenly. I pushed something wrong, What it was I could not say.
       </div>
       <div class="child3">
        Now all my data's gone and I long for yesterday-ay-ay-ay.
       </div>
       <div class="child4">
        Yesterday The need for back-ups seemed so far away. I knew my data was all here to stay, Now I believe in yesterday.
